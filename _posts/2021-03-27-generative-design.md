A goal-driven approach to design that uses automation to give designers and engineers better insight so they can make
faster, more informed design decisions. Your specific design parameters are defined to generate many — even thousands of potential solutions. 
You tell the software the results you want. With your guidance it arrives at the optimal design along with the data to prove which design performs best.


<h2>The history behind scripts, algorithms, and generative design</h2>
“Architects have been using scripting for decades to take the geometry created by a computer and
manipulate it in new ways, and a new generation of building design and construction was born.
Computers overruled the tyranny of the right angle, and shapes and curves became possible
not to just draw but to build.
“Those original scripts drove the programs available at the time, and forms like Zaha Hadid’s Heydar Aliyev Center were born. But today scripts
create algorithms that can control a much wider array of the digital tools deployed for building, yielding a new strategy with generative design
and construction—a name that reflects not just the power that generative tools give architects and builders, but the important connection
between the design and construction process that generative tools make possible.”

While computation can reduce the drudgery of repetitive tasks, generative design methods also help design and construction
teams reach the ultimate goal of reducing waste and cost.

<h2>Generative Design Process</h2>

Generative design allows for a more integrated workflow between human and computer, and as a result both are required to undertake a series of steps that allow the process to take place. These steps can be categorized into the following stages: generate, analyze, rank, evolve, explore, integrate.

<h3>Generate</h3>
This is the stage when design options are created or generated by the system, using algorithms and parameters specified by the designer.

<h3>Analyze</h3>
The designs generated in the previous step are now measured or analyzed on how well they achieve goals defined by the designer.

<h3>Rank</h3>
Based on the results of the analysis, design options are ordered or ranked.

<h3>Evolve</h3>
The process will use the ranking of the design options to figure out in which direction designs should be further developed or evolved.

<h3>Explore</h3>
Generated designs are compared or explored by the designer, inspecting both the geometry and evaluation results.

<h3>Integrate</h3>
After choosing a favorite design option, the designer uses or integrates this design into the wider project or design work.

<h2>Example</h2>
Refinery from Autodesk uses the NSGA-II optimization algorithm (a type of genetic algorithm), which is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm for multi-objective optimization. Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. A genetic algorithm is a population-based optimization. Population-based approaches maintain and improve multiple candidate solutions, often using population characteristics to guide the search. Each round of the optimization processed in the genetic algorithm is called a generation. So, when you set the generation value to 40, the process of selection, cross over, and mutation happens 40 times for each population of 40 designs. You can read more here. The seed simply says where the algorithm should start. If you keep the seed at “64” and then do another run with the same inputs, you should get the same answer.
