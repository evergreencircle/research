## Parametric Urbanism

Today’s architects and urbanists increasingly design and understand the form of buildings and cities through the lens of the parameter. Broadly defined as a variable within a system whose change affects other aspects of that system, parameters, or “parametricism”, are controlling or inspiring the design of everything from façade details to large-scale developments. Some architects have even proclaimed parametricism to be the future means by which all architectural and urban design will be executed. Underlying this somewhat bombastic and as yet undemonstrated proclamation is the fundamental change that computation has brought to architectural design in the past twenty or so years. While the underlying digital revolution is real and permanent, whether parametricism is merely a form of digital fetishism or the future of architectural design remains to be seen.
